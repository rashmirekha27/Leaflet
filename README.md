# leaflet-challenge

Added both HTML and JavaScript fikes for the analysis and created the Earthquake Visualization. Visited the (http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) page and choose a dataset to visualize and took dataset of past all earthquakes from past 7 days. Used Leaflet to create maps that plots all the earthquakes from your dataset based on their longitude and latitude and data markers that reflected the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appeared larger, and earthquakes with greater depth appeared darker in color.Also included Popups information when we hover over it and made legends that provieded legends of the map data.
